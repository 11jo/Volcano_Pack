I. Installation

Copy setup-volcano.exe, setup-volcano.tp2 and Volcano folder
to your BG2 directory (e.g. C:\BGII) and run setup-volcano.exe.
A successful installation ends with this message:

Important note:  After the installation, do not delete 
setup-volcano.exe, setup-volcano.tp2, or any files in Volcano folder:
they are needed for the uninstallation/reinstallation of this pack.



II. The Improved Volcano! Pack

This spell&item pack adds a merchant to the village of Amkethran.
This man (looks like a soldier) will stand near the Temple of Waukeen.
He offers extremely powerful spells and items, of course for a high price. 
(Note: such a very very powerful item content seems be popular for many players,
but it does not reflect my notion of a mod that conforms with the game balance. 
That is, I do not consider this mod as balanced in terms of the original game balance.
It is for the fun of those players who like it. I usually don't install it.)



III. Uninstallation, reinstallation

You can easily uninstall or reinstall this pack if you run setup-volcano.exe
and answer by pressing the correct letter (the setup automatically detects whether
Improved Volcano! Pack is installed)



IV. Troubleshooting

If you encounter any problems related to this spell&item pack, or you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to send a mail to baronius@blackwyrmlair.net!
I will reply as soon as I can.



V. HAVE FUN! :-)
