Spells and Items for BGII: Throne of Bhaal :
BGII: Throne of Bhaal, Baldur's Gate II: EE and the Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).


## Description:
------------

This spell&item pack adds a merchant to the village of Amkethran.
This man (looks like a soldier) will stand near the Temple of Waukeen.
He offers extremely powerful spells and items, of course for a high price. 
(Note: such a very very powerful item content seems be popular for many players,
but it does not reflect my notion of a mod that conforms with the game balance. 
That is, I do not consider this mod as balanced in terms of the original game balance.
It is for the fun of those players who like it. I usually don't install it.)


## Install:
--------

Copy setup-volcano.exe, setup-volcano.tp2 and Volcano folder
to your BG2 directory (e.g. C:\BGII) and run setup-volcano.exe.
A successful installation ends with this message:
SUCCESSFULLY INSTALLED[Improved Volcano Pack]
Important note:  After the installation, do not delete 
setup-volcano.exe, setup-volcano.tp2, or any files in Volcano folder:
they are needed for the uninstallation/reinstallation of this pack.

You can easily uninstall or reinstall this pack if you run setup-volcano.exe
and answer by pressing the correct letter (the setup automatically detects whether
Improved Volcano! Pack is installed)
